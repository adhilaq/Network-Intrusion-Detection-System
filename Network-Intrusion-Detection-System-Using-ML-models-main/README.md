# Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-Ensemble-Methods-And-Artificial-Neural-Networks
Proposed a multi-level IDS with seven ensemble machine learning algorithms that are running parallely (level 1) and a deep learning algorithm - Forward Feedback ANN (level 2) which would help to overcome the problems of the existing IDS and optimally detect intrusion in any network.
